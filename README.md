# Rock-Scissors-Paper Simulation

To start the game, simply run Game.java

At the beginning of the game, a random number of scissors, papers and stones will appear on the screen. You have the ability to manipulate their number using keyboard inputs.
It is also possible to clear all objects on the display; to do this, press the spacebar during the game.

The game was written in Java using internal libraries such as JFrame, Abstract Window Toolkit, Random, KeyEvent, KeyListener and others.
